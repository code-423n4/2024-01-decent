hello, just wanted to confirm if this contest will run only for 3 days? opens the 19th and closes the 22?


[01/17/2024 18:56] knownfactc4_29311
Yes, that's correct.

Is there a  specific reason to do the competition for only 3 days, and over the weekend? I suppose this severely limits both the number of wardens able to participate, as well as their ability to analyse the protocol properly


[01/17/2024 19:07] aodkgkrogrogoovg2o3btivr
its a small contest, only  900 sloc

900 sloc in 3 days is still a pretty wild turn around for an actual thorough review, but it is what it is

to do so, would have to copy your api key from arbiscan to set that up

I am trying to deploy it on sepolia, is there a way to do it without arbiscan api key


[01/20/2024 07:52] nmirchev8
Hey,
How would the `feeSplitter` owner sign each `swapAndExecute` instructions?


[01/20/2024 07:59] mladenov0603
I've tried to add it in env file but still does work ```ARBISCAN_API_KEY=key```


[01/20/2024 08:05] 0xstalin
most likely through an API or smth that connects to a backend where is encrypted the private key of the `signer` account


[01/20/2024 08:08] nmirchev8
So there would be validation if the instructuins and fees are with valid values and generate sig each time?


[01/20/2024 08:10] 0xstalin
I think this api will receive the instructions, it will compute the fees for the operation being performed and the signed will sign a message to validate that the fee's data is correct and the user is paying the correct amount of fees for the type of operation being performed


[01/20/2024 08:10] 0xstalin
I might be wrong, but that's the conclusion I came up with

did you remove `.example` from the env file's name?

why require error msgs are concanted? this is the first i have seen something like this thats why I'm just curious: ```js
        require(
            destinationBridgeAdapter[dstChainId] != address(0),
            string.concat("dst chain address not set ")
        );
```
Does it help save some gas? 🤔


[01/20/2024 10:00] niser93
No 😅 my bad! Now i'm having this error. I didn't set TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY and MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY in.env, but just the FOUNDRY one

 I use a free tier alchemy and so far I have filled the following RPC
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL
ARBITRUM_GOERLI_RPC_URL
ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL

Now, thats the limit.

☝️ great summary


[01/20/2024 19:43] nmirchev8
So the flow if I want to swap USDC for WETH and bridge from Mainnet to Arb is:
1. API query to calc the fees for provided params
2. With provided sig - call to "swapAndBridge" 
3. The flow between contracts

?


[01/20/2024 20:10] volokinn
Hey @zev2axa, is the "paymentOperator" a contract that is currently in scope?


[01/20/2024 20:14] zev2axa
not in scope... payment operator typically gets used in the case of secondary marketplace orders, i.e. seaport... where essentially, lets say I need to execute a transaction to a specific contract address, but i need to make the erc20 approval to an address other than that contract. believe seaport uses this to handle all the royalty payouts etc, so you approve the payment operator, and then call the target address... in most cases payment operator and target would be the same address

In swapper.swapExactIn contract receive tokens  from uniswap(amountOut) and..send them to receiver. But next to code, in utb._swapAndExecute we call executor.execute() and executor transferFrom utb tokens..(or eth via payable keyword). but in this moment contact utb dont have any tokens i think, because swapper all received tokens sent to receiver.. maybe utb is receiver or user? if user.. i dont understand how it works)

It does say the "first 48h of an audit". Isn't the point of the policy to not extend contests close to the deadline without adding more to the pot?

{Reactions}
👆 (8) 

[01/22/2024 17:55] sockdrawermoney
that was the intent, but (a) the policy didn't take into account the logistics of a 3-day contests starting on a friday, and (b) it also sounds like this was actually confirmed with the sponsor a couple days ago but, (c) CAs work weekdays so it wasn't formally announced (though it was indicated by the sponsor). we'll clarify the policy and tighten up our process.

Would the swap fee depends on the amount of tokens to swap or only payload?


[01/23/2024 08:44] taner2344
if bridge is Stargate , fee  6 BPS if it's decent bridge there is no fee i think (  + transaction fees)

hey, what is `path` in swapParams for?
isn't the `tokenIn`, `tokenOut` and `direction` sufficient for the swap ?


[01/23/2024 10:03] zdravkohr
Token in, tick spacing and token out

Guys, I've a specific question for a submission that I made and I need someone that has access to the submissions just to check for something that I'm wondering about. Who can I text to for such a question?


[01/26/2024 11:45] zdravkohr
It is probably not allowed, but it depends on your question


[01/26/2024 11:45] zdravkohr
What is it


[01/26/2024 11:57] rottenwilde
Mostly related with a submission regarding specific case in the logic of one of the contracts, which I covered by a test. But I don't remember If I mentioned that the test use specific params that doesn't fully cover the whole issue which I reported, even it is absolutely valid as scenario. That's my first submission and I don't have a big experience in the platform, that's why I'm just asking


[01/26/2024 12:48] mrpotatomagic
you must've received a mail of your issue when you submitted it so you can check it there


[01/26/2024 12:51] rottenwilde
Oh, yea, I saw it. Thank you!

@everyone Wardens, a newbie here. I submitted one finding to the Decent contest. When will the results be announced? Do you get notified if you qualify for a reward? Is 1 finding enough to get any reward, considering it's a Critical one?

yes you will get notified here if your finding validated

@everyone Ahh, got it, thank you! Is there any way to check whether my finding was a duplicate, or I was really the first one to submit it? I already checked the https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/bot-report.md and https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md reports.

if it's not in bot reports (and not in the known-issues section of the contest) - then it's likely not a duplicate. Moreover, it does not matter if you submitted it first. If someone else found the same issue as you - the reward for this issue will be shared between you and that person.

thankyou
